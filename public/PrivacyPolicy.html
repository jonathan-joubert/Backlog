    <h1>Privacy Policy for Backlog</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 2025-09-13<br />
       <strong>Last Updated:</strong> 2025-09-13</p>

    <h2 id="info-controller">1. Information Controller</h2>
    <p><strong>App Developer:</strong> Jonathan Reece Joubert<br />
       <strong>Contact:</strong> <a href="mailto:jjoubert@fibco.co.za">jjoubert@fibco.co.za</a></p>
    <p>This privacy policy is intended to meet applicable legal requirements and Google Play Developer Policy expectations.</p>

    <h2 id="collected">2. What Information Is Collected</h2>
    <p><strong>Short summary:</strong> Backlog does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information to our servers. All firearm and application details you enter remain only on your device/browser unless you explicitly choose otherwise.</p>

    <h3>User-entered data (local only)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Firearm application reference numbers</li>
      <li>Firearm serial numbers, make, and model</li>
      <li>License issue and expiry dates</li>
      <li>Notes or comments</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Technical data (local only)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Notification preferences</li>
      <li>App settings</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Backlog does <strong>not</strong> collect identity numbers, biometric data, financial information, or other categories of sensitive personal information.</p>

    <h2 id="processing">3. How Information Is Processed</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> All data is stored only on your device or in your browser's local storage (if using the web version).</li>
      <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> Renewal reminders and local alarms are scheduled on-device.</li>
      <li><strong>Status Checks:</strong> If you opt to check application status, the app may connect directly from your device to the official SAPS website to fetch status data. These requests are initiated by your device and not routed via our servers.</li>
      <li><strong>No Servers:</strong> We do not operate servers that receive or store your firearm or personal data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="third-party">4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Backlog may use the following third-party services for operational functionality. The use of these services does not result in firearm or personal details being transmitted to us:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Google Play Services</strong> — for app updates and optional crash reporting (if enabled by you).</li>
      <li><strong>Firebase / Google Cloud Messaging (FCM)</strong> — used for push notification delivery tokens only. No firearm/application data is sent to Firebase as part of these tokens.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you enable any optional diagnostic or analytics features in the app, those features will be disclosed in-app and in this privacy policy.</p>

    <h2 id="storage-security">5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Data remains on your device. If you uninstall Backlog or clear your browser storage, stored information will be permanently deleted.</li>
      <li>Notifications stop automatically when the app is removed.</li>
      <li>We recommend device-level protections (PIN/biometrics, encrypted device storage) to keep your data safe.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="popia-rights">6. Your Rights Under POPIA</h2>
    <p>Because Backlog does not collect or store personal data on our servers, you retain full control of your records on device. You can view, edit, export, or delete all records directly in the app or by clearing browser storage.</p>
    <p>To stop notifications, use device settings or uninstall the app.</p>

    <h2 id="children">7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Backlog is a utility app that provides firearm license application status checks and renewal reminders. It contains no firearm imagery, instructions, or purchase functionality. The app is suitable for users of all ages.</p>
    <p>We do not knowingly collect or process personal information from children. All data remains on-device under the user’s control.</p>

    <h2 id="affiliation">8. Affiliation &amp; Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>Backlog is <strong>not</strong> affiliated with the South African Police Service (SAPS). SAPS is solely responsible for the accuracy and availability of any information on their public website. Backlog is a personal tracker tool and does not constitute legal advice.</p>

    <h2 id="updates">9. Updates to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If we change this privacy policy, users will be notified with an app update (and the policy date above will be updated). You may withdraw consent at any time by uninstalling the app or clearing browser data.</p>

    <h2 id="contact">10. Contact Information</h2>
    <p><strong>Data Protection Officer:</strong> Jonathan Reece Joubert<br />
       <strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:jjoubert@fibco.co.za">jjoubert@fibco.co.za</a><br />
       <strong>Location:</strong> South Africa</p>

    <h2 id="consent">Consent Statement</h2>
    <p>By using Backlog, you acknowledge and consent that all firearm and application information is stored and managed locally on your device/browser, and is not shared with us or other third parties except as described above (e.g., push notification tokens to FCM).</p>
